This is a Simple Attendance Project Using the Concepts of OpenCV and Python Programming language.
-I also used a library called face_recognition library for facial recognition.
--list of Libarires used-
-face_recognition
-cv2
-numpy
-datetime
-os

Also One additional feature added is that after detecting the face it will also write in a Csv file so as to keep a track over the attendence.
hence, a attendence csv file is also mantained.
